Question

1. Middleware provide a convenient mechanism for inspecting and filtering HTTP requests entering your application. 
For example, Laravel includes a middleware that verifies the user of your application is authenticated. If the 
user is not authenticated, the middleware will redirect the user to your application's login screen. However, if 
the user is authenticated, the middleware will allow the request to proceed further into the application.

2. Global Middleware: a middleware to run during every HTTP request to your application.
   Group Middleware: group multiple middleware under a single key to make it easier to assign into a route.
   Route Middleware: a middleware assign into a route using chain.
